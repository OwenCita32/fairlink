# FairLink

FairLink is a privacy-safe financial inclusion prototype that enables
banks and telecom providers to collaborate without sharing raw data
or exposing personal identities.

## Problem
Millions of people are credit-invisible due to the lack of formal
banking history, despite having consistent behavioral data from
telecom usage.

## Solution
FairLink uses a simulated Data Clean Room in Snowflake to combine
anonymized bank and telco signals into an explainable Inclusion Score,
supported by AI-generated insights.

## Tech Stack
- Snowflake Data Cloud
- Secure Views (Clean Room Simulation)
- Snowflake Cortex (AI)
- Snowflake Streamlit
- SQL & Python

## Privacy Approach
- No raw data sharing
- No PII exposure
- Purpose-bound analysis
